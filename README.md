# Manchester React â€”Â Client

- `npm i`
- `npm start`

Thanks to all contributions from everyone who attend A Day of React. Here's the MVP of the new mancreact.com. It integrates with the Meetup.com API, into a React client. We've even got web socket integration on the event page.

It would be great for this repo to become a learning ground for anyone who attends [Manchester React](www.meetup.com/Manchester-React-User-Group/).
